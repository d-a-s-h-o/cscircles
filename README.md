# Solutions to the CS Circles Platform (Topics 0 - 18)
Included are all the solutions to the CS Circles platform as required for the CA247 Module.

> ℹ️ These are uploaded to help you understand the problems and to demonstrate a working solution to each problem. You are encouraged to try each problem before jumping to these solutions. The solution to the last problem (Primed for Takeoff) will be released Friday morning, in order to invite you to give it a proper try beforehand. It's a really unintuitive problem that requires more robust problem solving.

Best of luck.... Dasho :)
